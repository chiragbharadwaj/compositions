# Compositions
## Background
These are my musical compositions. I mostly write classical music for solo piano. I have been composing pieces since 2007, when I was eleven years old. Most of them are not very good, but I hope to write some serious pieces over time. The works progress in difficulty as the opus number increases, given that my earlier compositions were written with far less experience, and thus with far less complexity for the classically-trained pianist.

A lot of the works here were originally handwritten. I digitized them after 2016 to the most accurate degree possible using LilyPond, a music scorewriting service, so as to have a modifiable backup of the hard copy. PDF versions of the works are available alongside the LilyPond source code for each work. MIDI versions of the works are available upon request.

Each opus has its own story (a README, to borrow the modern terminology, as it were) and a description of each constituent piece therein. Many of these descriptions, like their accompanying works, were written in an earlier time. The original wording has been mostly preserved to commemorate the original ideas and intents of the earlier compositions. Alternate descriptions have been lended to the works at large at my own discretion.

Let me know what you think!
