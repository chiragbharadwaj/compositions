# Compositions
## Background
These are my musical compositions. I mostly write classical music for solo piano. I have been composing pieces since 2007, when I was eleven years old. Most of them are not very good, but I hope to write some serious pieces over time. The works progress in difficulty as the opus number increases, given that my earlier compositions were written with far less experience, and thus with far less complexity for the classically-trained pianist.

A lot of the works here were originally handwritten. I digitized them after 2016 to the most accurate degree possible using LilyPond, a music scorewriting service, so as to have a modifiable backup of the hard copy. PDF versions of the works are available alongside the LilyPond source code for each work. MIDI versions of the works are available upon request.

Let me know what you think!
